# 30days-portfolio
30 days 30 sites challenge. Day 1: Portfolio
As first site for this challange we were asked to build a portfolio. I'm using Bootstrap but overall I'm a bit tired of the typical
Bootstrap template you see around the web.
It took me a few hours and was done quite quickly for my standards.
The best part is that I've discovered how to make a lovely masonry gallery to use.
Thanks to the creator.
